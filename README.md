Natural language includes all the distinctions we find worthwhile to make about one another. Personality models like the Big Five are based off factorization of natural language. This is a flexible method to vectorize words with deep learning models. That representation contains two factors: socialization and self-actualization. This is interesting because a search for a descriptive framework produces a theoretically satisfying one. It also supports other empirical work like Digman's who found these two traits in a [meta-analysis of Big Five survey data](https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/1997-42257-010).
